# LowRes NX

LowRes NX is a simulated retro game console, which can be programmed
in the classic BASIC language. It has its own technical
specifications, but it's very much inspired by actual 8-bit and 16-bit
game consoles. It doesn't only look and sound retro, but actually
works like classic hardware.

LowRes NX simulates graphics, sound and I/O chips and makes their
hardware registers accessable in its memory map. Although most of the
features are available via simple BASIC statements, it's possible to
program video, audio and I/O directly by accessing the memory.

Imagine LowRes NX as a handheld game console with a d-pad, two action
buttons and a little rubber keyboard below a slidable touchscreen.
